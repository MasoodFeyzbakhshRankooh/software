This is a meta-level repository for gathering software related to ASPTOOLS under one roof. In general, the collection provides an approach to *translation-based* Answer Set Programming (ASP) which deploys ASP for knowledge representation but enables the use of different kinds of solvers for the search of answer sets. Besides this overall purpose, the collection includes also other utilities, see individual repositories for comments. 

For the moment, the ASPTOOLS collection builds on the following publicly available repositories:

1. *asplib*
2. *asptranslate*

Some utilies have been previously published as binaries under the respective
[Aalto website](https://research.ics.aalto.fi/software/asp/) but they are
gradually moving under this project. The collection is mostly legacy
research software that are made public in hope being useful for future
research.
